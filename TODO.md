### 🔄 In Progress Tasks
- [ ] **Complete the 8-site expansion (Resort Home + SUUMO)**
- [ ] **Research SUUMO anti-bot measures** - *Analysis started: Requires JavaScript rendering, sophisticated anti-bot detection*
- [ ] **Optimize 6-site system performance** - *Current runtime: >10 minutes, target: <5 minutes*

### 📋 Pending Tasks
- [ ] **Fix Royal Resort extraction issues** - *37 properties found, 0 extracted due to element handling*
- [ ] **Implement parallel scraping to reduce runtime** - *Sequential scraping is the bottleneck*
- [ ] **Add Resort Home to scraper factory and test integration** - *Scraper created, needs factory integration*
- [ ] **Research and implement SUUMO scraper** - *Requires BrowserScraper approach, anti-bot countermeasures*
